A Druid rotation primarily used for leveling and BGs... It needs a lot more work!!

I will be slowly adding more PvP logic, including engineering items, trinkets etc.

Changing forms currently is manual.

To keep the rotation bar in a fixed location - Move the bar somewhere on the screen where you want it to stay. Turn the main Cromulon (left most button) off then back on.

You can critique my code, as I am definitely still learning :)

To use spell queue system, macro your abilites like below:<br>
#showtooltip Wrath<br>
/run _G.QueueDruidCast("Wrath", "target")<br>
/cast Wrath
